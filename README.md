## Overview

The bunkest of bots, first of his name. Bunkbot is a small sandbox discord bot meant for privately run servers who want a strange sandbox bot to run and customize for fun.

## Prerequisites:
**Required**:   
NodeJS 14.18.0 or higher

Many of Bunkbot's features use (free) API accounts. Bunkbot will still load without these accounts, but will not support the functions that require them. Below are the APIs Bunkbot uses:
- Discord: [Developer Account](https://discord.com/developers/applications)
- Chat: [Cleverbot](https://cleverbot.io/)
- Weather: [Open Weather](https://openweathermap.org/api)
- Gif Responses: [Tenor](https://tenor.com/gifapi/documentation)
- Youtube: [Google Developer Account](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3)
  
<!--
## Setup
Running Bunkbot's setup will provide a `config.json` at the root of the project. You may opt for defaults and come back to edit the configuration file manually later.

**Linux/OSX**
At a terminal, run: 
```bash
sh setup.sh
```
  
**Windows**
  In a command prompt or terminal, run:  
  ```
  pip install -r requirements.txt && python -m src.setup.setup
  ```
  
 ## Running the bot
Once the setup is complete, the bot is ready. Run `python3 main.py` at the root of the project to boot Bunkbot.
